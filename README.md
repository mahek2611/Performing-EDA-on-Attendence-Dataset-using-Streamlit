This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an attendance dataset using Streamlit. 
The objective is to clean and preprocess the dataset, perform descriptive statistics, visualize key metrics, and identify attendance patterns through an interactive web application. 
The tools used include Python, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations, Plotly for interactive visualizations, and Streamlit for app deployment. 
The dataset comprises fields like Student ID, Date, Status, Class/Grade, Subject, and Teacher. Data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, transforming date fields, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numeric features.
Key analyses include an overview of total records and attendance rate, time series analysis of trends, categorical analysis by class, subject, and teacher, and correlations to identify factors impacting attendance. 
The Streamlit app features interactive filters for specific classes, subjects, teachers, date ranges, and dynamic plots to explore variable relationships.
